```csharp

public static double FahrenheitToCelsius(double temp)
public static double CelsiusToFahrenheit(double temp)
public static double KelvinToCelsius(double temp)
public static double CelsiusToKelvin(double temp) 
public static double FahrenheitToKelvin(double temp) 
public static double CelsiusToFahrenheit(double temp)

```
and implement one unit test for each


3. Implement a method that converts from __any temperature system to any other__ **including itself**
4. Unit test it for all possibilities
